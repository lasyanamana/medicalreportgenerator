The Medical Report Generator is an AI-powered tool that processes X-ray or MRI images to generate a preliminary medical report. It uses ResNet50 for feature extraction and a T5 Transformer model for report generation. The model is designed to assist medical professionals in analyzing medical scans efficiently. Using T5 Transformer to Generate Medical Reports A pretrained T5-small transformer model is used to generate a textual medical report based on extracted image features. The model takes an input prompt and produces a diagnostic summary. Features: Makes use of ResNet50 to extract medical features from X-ray and MRI pictures.

Uses T5 Transformer to create AI-assisted medical reports.

Allows for GPU acceleration to speed up processing.

Pipeline for processing medical images that is easy to use and effective.
